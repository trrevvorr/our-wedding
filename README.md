# Simple Wedding Site

I created this website for my wedding. I wanted something:

-   custom (always found something to nitpick on any free template site)
-   sharable (wrote this in such a way that it would be easy to fork and customize for yourself)
-   free (using github pages and firebase, don't even have to pay for a host)

To see it in action: https://trrevvorr.github.io/our-wedding/?key=demo

## Run Locally

-   `cd our-wedding`
-   `npm i`
-   `npm run serve`
